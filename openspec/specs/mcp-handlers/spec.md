# MCP Handlers Specification

> Behavioural requirements for specific MCP tool handlers (`src/core/services/mcp-handlers/*`)
> beyond the cross-cutting tool-quality rules in `mcp-quality`. Tool output classification and the
> conclusion-over-graph contract live in `mcp-quality`; this domain captures handler-specific
> navigation semantics.

## Requirements

### Requirement: CoarseToFineMapNavigation

The system SHALL expose a two-tier map of the call graph: a region tier where each community is a
single super-node with aggregated inter-region super-edges, and a function tier reached by drilling
into one region. The region tier SHALL be derivable without reading any function body, and drilling
in SHALL reuse the existing community-membership view. The region tier SHALL ship in the opt-in
`navigation` preset, not the minimal default surface.

#### Scenario: Region view returns super-nodes and super-edges only

- **GIVEN** an analyzed repository with multiple communities
- **WHEN** `get_map` is called without a community id
- **THEN** the response contains one super-node per community (label, member count, top files, top
  landmark) and super-edges weighted by inter-region call count, and contains no individual function
  bodies

#### Scenario: Drilling into a region returns its functions

- **GIVEN** a community id from the region view
- **WHEN** `get_map` is called with that id
- **THEN** the response is the function-granularity view of that community, equivalent to
  `get_cluster`

#### Scenario: Large maps disclose truncation

- **GIVEN** a repository with more communities than the region-view bound
- **WHEN** the region view is produced
- **THEN** it returns the top regions by size, sets a `truncated` flag, and reports how many regions
  were omitted (no silent capping)
